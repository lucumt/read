      <description>Top 9 website performance metrics you cannot ignore:&#xA;Load Time: This is the time taken by the web browser to download and display the webpage. It’s measured in milliseconds.&#xA;Time to First Byte (TTFB): It’s the time taken by the browser to receive the first byte of data from the web server. TTFB is crucial because it indicates the general ability of the server to handle traffic.&#xA;Request Count: The number of HTTP requests a browser has to make to fully load the page.</description>

      <description>How do we detect node failures in distributed systems? . . The diagram below shows top 6 Heartbeat Detection Mechanisms.&#xA;Heartbeat mechanisms are crucial in distributed systems for monitoring the health and status of various components. Here are several types of heartbeat detection mechanisms commonly used in distributed systems:&#xA;🔹 Push-Based Heartbeat The most basic form of heartbeat involves a periodic signal sent from one node to another or to a monitoring service.</description>
