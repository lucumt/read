Top 9 Architectural Patterns for Data and Communication Flow 

🔹 Peer-to-Peer <br/>
The Peer-to-Peer pattern involves direct communication between two components without the need for a central coordinator. 

🔹 API Gateway <br/>
An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests to the backend services of an application. 

🔹 Pub-Sub <br/>
The Pub-Sub pattern decouples the producers of messages (publishers) from the consumers of messages (subscribers) through a message broker. 

🔹 Request-Response <br/>
This is one of the most fundamental integration patterns, where a client sends a request to a server and waits for a response. 

🔹 Event Sourcing <br/>
Event Sourcing involves storing the state changes of an application as a sequence of events. 

🔹 ETL <br/>
ETL is a data integration pattern used to gather data from multiple sources, transform it into a structured format, and load it into a destination database. 

🔹 Batching <br/>
Batching involves accumulating data over a period or until a certain threshold is met before processing it as a single group. 

🔹 Streaming Processing <br/>
Streaming Processing allows for the continuous ingestion, processing, and analysis of data streams in real-time. 

🔹 Orchestration <br/>
Orchestration involves a central coordinator (an orchestrator) managing the interactions between distributed components or services to achieve a workflow or business process.
