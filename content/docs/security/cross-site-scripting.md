Everything You Need to Know About Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

XSS, a prevalent vulnerability, occurs when malicious scripts are injected into web pages, often through input fields. Check out the diagram below for a deeper dive into how this vulnerability emerges when user input is improperly handled and subsequently returned to the client, leaving systems vulnerable to exploitation.

Understanding the distinction between Reflective and Stored XSS is crucial. Reflective XSS involves immediate execution of the injected script, while Stored XSS persists over time, posing long-term threats. Dive into the diagrams for a comprehensive comparison of these attack vectors.

Imagine this scenario: A cunning hacker exploits XSS to clandestinely harvest user credentials, such as cookies, from their browser, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches. It's a chilling reality.

But fret not! Our flyer also delves into effective mitigation strategies, empowering you to fortify your systems against XSS attacks. From input validation and output encoding to implementing strict Content Security Policies (CSP), we've got you covered.

Over to you: How can we amplify user awareness to proactively prevent falling victim to XSS attacks? Share your insights and strategies below! Let's collaboratively bolster our web defenses and foster a safer digital environment.
