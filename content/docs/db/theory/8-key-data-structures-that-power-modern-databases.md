8 Key Data Structures That Power Modern Databases
🔹Skiplist: a common in-memory index type. Used in Redis
🔹Hash index: a very common implementation of the “Map” data structure (or “Collection”)
🔹SSTable: immutable on-disk “Map” implementation
🔹LSM tree: Skiplist + SSTable. High write throughput
🔹B-tree: disk-based solution. Consistent read/write performance
🔹Inverted index: used for document indexing. Used in Lucene
🔹Suffix tree: for string pattern search
🔹R-tree: multi-dimension search, such as finding the nearest neighbor
